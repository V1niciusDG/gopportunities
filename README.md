## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the Vacancy Registration System. This system is designed to facilitate the management and registration of job vacancies. Built using Go, the application provides a streamlined and efficient way to handle job postings, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete vacancies with ease.

The system is built with a focus on performance and reliability, leveraging Go's concurrency features and efficient database handling. It features a RESTful API that interacts with a PostgreSQL database, making it easy to integrate with other applications or services.

## Goal

The primary goal of the Vacancy Registration System is to provide an intuitive and reliable platform for managing job vacancies. Key objectives of the system include:

- Efficient Vacancy Management: Allow users to easily create, update, and delete job vacancies.
- Search and Filter: Enable users to search and filter job vacancies based on various criteria such as job title, location, and company.
- User-Friendly Interface: Provide a clean and straightforward API for interacting with the system, ensuring ease of use for developers and integrators.
- Robust Data Handling: Ensure that data is handled efficiently and securely, using PostgreSQL for reliable data storage and retrieval.
- Scalability and Performance: Design the system to handle a growing number of job vacancies and user requests with optimal performance.

## Running the Go Project

#### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure that you have the following installed:

- **Go**: The Go programming language.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform.

### Install Go

1. **Download the Installer**:

   - Visit the [Go Downloads page](https://golang.org/dl/) and download the installer appropriate for your operating system.

2. **Run the Installer**:

   - Follow the instructions provided by the installer to complete the Go installation.

3. **Verify Installation**:
   - Open a terminal and run:
     ```bash
     go version
     ```
   - You should see the installed Go version.

### Install Docker

1. **Download the Installer**:

   - Visit the [Docker Downloads page](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and download the installer appropriate for your operating system.

2. **Run the Installer**:

   - Follow the instructions provided by the installer to complete the Docker installation.

3. **Verify Installation**:
   - Open a terminal and run:
     ```bash
     docker --version
     ```
   - You should see the installed Docker version.

## Steps to Run the Project

### Clone the Project Repository

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   - Open a terminal and execute the following command with your project repository URL:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
     ```
   - Replace `https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git` with your actual repository URL.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   - Change to the directory of the cloned project:
     ```bash
     cd your-repository-name
     ```

### Run Docker Compose

1. **Start Containers**:
   - Ensure that the `docker-compose.yml` file is present in the project directory.
   - Execute the following command to start the containers:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up
     ```
   - To run containers in the background, use:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d
     ```

### Install Project Dependencies

1. **Run the Project**:
   - With the containers running, install the project dependencies by executing:
     ```bash
     go run main.go
     ```
   - Ensure that the `main.go` file is located in the root directory of the project or provide the correct path.

## Summary

1. **Install Go and Docker**: Download and install Go and Docker according to your operating system.
2. **Ensure Docker is Running**: Make sure Docker is started before running `docker-compose up`.
3. **Clone the Repository**: Use `git clone` to obtain the project code.
4. **Run Docker Compose**: Use `docker-compose up` to start the necessary containers.
5. **Install Dependencies**: Run `go run main.go` to install project dependencies.
